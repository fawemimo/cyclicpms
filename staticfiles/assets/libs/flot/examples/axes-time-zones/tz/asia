# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
#
# Gwillim Law writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks & Pottenger is the source for
# entries through 1990, and IATA SSIM is the source for entries afterwards.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).

# Armenia
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger have Yerevan switching to 3:00 (with Russian DST)
# in spring 1991, then to 4:00 with no DST in fall 1995, then
# readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger, even
# when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
# reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn't use DST
# in 1996, though it did use DST in 1995.  IATA SSIM (1991/1998) reports that
# Armenia switched from 3:00 to 4:00 in 1998 and observed DST after 1991,
# but started switching at 3:00s in 1998.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-06-15):
# While Russia abandoned DST in 2011, Armenia may choose to
# follow Russia's "old" rules.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2012-02-10):
# According to News Armenia, on Feb 9, 2012,
# http://newsarmenia.ru/society/20120209/42609695.html

# China

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, 1986-02-17 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.
#
# . . .I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too
# painful to suck in another copy..  So, here is what I have for
# DST start/end dates for Peking's time zone (info from AP):
#
#     1986 May 4 - Sept 14
#     1987 mid-April - ??

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (1989-01-19):
# CHINA               8 H  AHEAD OF UTC  ALL OF CHINA, INCL TAIWAN
# CHINA               9 H  AHEAD OF UTC  APR 17 - SEP 10

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that China (except for Hong Kong and Macau)
# has had a single time zone since 1980 May 1, observing summer DST
# from 1986 through 1991; this contradicts Devine's
# note about Time magazine, though apparently _something_ happened in 1986.
# Go with Shanks & Pottenger for now.  I made up names for the other
# pre-1980 time zones.

# From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):
# BTW, I did some research on-line and found some info regarding these five
# historic timezones from some Taiwan websites.  And yes, there are official
# Chinese names for these locales (before 1949).
#
# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
# I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the
# http://www.astro.com/atlas site [with provinces and county
# boundaries summarized below]....  A few other exceptions were two
# counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
# counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
# therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege
# county is GMT+8 according to astro.com while Baiyu county is GMT+6
# (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two
# counties are mistakes in the astro.com data.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-02-11):
# I just now checked Google News for western news sources that talk
# about China's single time zone, and couldn't find anything before 1986
# talking about China being in one time zone.  (That article was: Jim
# Mann, "A clumsy embrace for another western custom: China on daylight
# time--sort of", Los Angeles Times, 1986-05-05.  By the way, this
# article confirms the tz database's data claiming that China began
# observing daylight saving time in 1986.
#
# From Thomas S. Mullaney (2008-02-11):
# I think you're combining two subjects that need to treated
# separately: daylight savings (which, you're correct, wasn't
# implemented until the 1980s) and the unified time zone centered near
# Beijing (which was implemented in 1949). Briefly, there was also a
# "Lhasa Time" in Tibet and "Urumqi Time" in Xinjiang. The first was
# ceased, and the second eventually recognized (again, in the 1980s).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# There seems to be a good chance China switched to a single time zone in 1949
# rather than in 1980 as Shanks & Pottenger have it, but we don't have a
# reliable documentary source saying so yet, so for now we still go with
# Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
# Almost all (>99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
# Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
# but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
# what is called "Beijing time." When Han make an appointment in Chinese
# they implicitly use Beijing time.
#
# On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
# population of Xinjiang, typically use "Xinjiang time" which is two
# hours behind Beijing time, or UTC +0600. The government of the Xinjiang
# Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
# local governments such as the Urumqi city government use both times in
# publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
# "Urumqi time." When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
# they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
#
# (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
# widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
# Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
#
# (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
# or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
# the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
# time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
# others moving their clocks ahead.)
#
# ...an example of an official website using of Urumqi time.

# From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
# With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
# English "transliterations" (w/o using non-English symbols):
#
# 1. Wulumuqi...
# 2. Kashi...
# 3. Urumqi...
# 4. Kashgar...
# ...
# 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Urumqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
# 1960's. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
# countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
#
# 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don't know of any
# start date for Xinjiang time.
#
# Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
# publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
# Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
# not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)

# From Lee Yiu Chung (2009-10-24):
# I found there are some mistakes for the...DST rule for Hong
# Kong. [According] to the DST record from Hong Kong Observatory (actually,
# it is not [an] observatory, but the official meteorological agency of HK,
# and also serves as the official timing agency), there are some missing
# and incorrect rules. Although the exact switch over time is missing, I
# think 3:30 is correct. The official DST record for Hong Kong can be
# obtained from

# Taiwan

# Shanks & Pottenger write that Taiwan observed DST during 1945, when it
# was still controlled by Japan.  This is hard to believe, but we don't
# have any other information.

# Georgia
# From Paul Eggert (1994-11-19):
# Today's _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
# an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
# an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.
#
# From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
#
# From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
#
# Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
# republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
# is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
# ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
# Mikhail Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
# of integration into Europe.

# From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
# Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
# [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
# Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
# +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document
# about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,
# because we just DIDN'T ISSUE document about switching to winter time....
# I don't know what can be done, especially knowing that some years ago our
# DST rules where changed THREE TIMES during one month.

# East Timor

# See Indonesia for the 1945 transition.

# From Joao Carrascalao, brother of the former governor of East Timor, in
# <a href="http://etan.org/et99c/december/26-31/30ETMAY.htm">
# East Timor may be late for its millennium
# </a> (1999-12-26/31):
# Portugal tried to change the time forward in 1974 because the sun
# rises too early but the suggestion raised a lot of problems with the
# Timorese and I still don't think it would work today because it
# conflicts with their way of life.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# We don't have any record of the above attempt.
# Most likely our records are incomplete, but we have no better data.

# <a href="http://www.hri.org/news/world/undh/last/00-08-16.undh.html">
# From Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General
# (2000-08-16)</a>:
# The Cabinet of the East Timor Transition Administration decided
# today to advance East Timor's time by one hour.  The time change,
# which will be permanent, with no seasonal adjustment, will happen at
# midnight on Saturday, September 16.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-05-28), overriding Shanks & Pottenger:

# The proposed law agreed upon by the Knesset Interior Committee on
# 2005-02-14 is that, for 2005 and beyond, DST starts at 02:00 the
# last Friday before April 2nd (i.e. the last Friday in March or April
# 1st itself if it falls on a Friday) and ends at 02:00 on the Saturday
# night _before_ the fast of Yom Kippur.
#
# Those who can read Hebrew can view the announcement at:

#	ftp://ftp.cs.huji.ac.il/pub/tz/announcements/2005+beyond.ps

# From Paul Eggert (2012-10-26):
# I used Ephraim Silverberg's dst-israel.el program
# <ftp://ftp.cs.huji.ac.il/pub/tz/software/dst-israel.el> (2005-02-20)
# along with Ed Reingold's cal-hebrew in GNU Emacs 21.4,
# to generate the transitions from 2005 through 2012.
# (I replaced "lastFri" with "Fri>=26" by hand.)
# The spring transitions all correspond to the following Rule:
#
# Rule	Zion	2005	2012	-	Mar	Fri>=26	2:00	1:00	D
#
# but older zic implementations (e.g., Solaris 8) do not support
# "Fri>=26" to mean April 1 in years like 2005, so for now we list the
# springtime transitions explicitly.

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2012-10-18):
# Yesterday, the Interior Ministry Committee, after more than a year
# past, approved sending the proposed June 2011 changes to the Time
# Decree Law back to the Knesset for second and third (final) votes
# before the upcoming elections on Jan. 22, 2013.  Hence, although the
# changes are not yet law, they are expected to be so before February 2013.
#
# As of 2013, DST starts at 02:00 on the Friday before the last Sunday in March.
# DST ends at 02:00 on the first Sunday after October 1, unless it occurs on the
# second day of the Jewish Rosh Hashana holiday, in which case DST ends a day
# later (i.e. at 02:00 the first Monday after October 2).
# [Rosh Hashana holidays are factored in until 2100.]

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2012-11-05):
# The Knesset passed today (in second and final readings) the amendment to the
# Time Decree Law making the changes ... law.

# Japan

# `9:00' and `JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but ``the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.''

# From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times
# <http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm>:
# Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
# [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
# daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
# deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
# dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
# Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
# of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
# wanted to keep it.)

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that DST in Japan during those years was as follows:
# Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S
Rule	Japan	1948	only	-	May	Sun>=1	2:00	1:00	D

Rule	Japan	1950	1951	-	May	Sun>=1	2:00	1:00	D
# but the only locations using it (for birth certificates, presumably, since
# their audience is astrologers) were US military bases.  For now, assume
# that for most purposes daylight-saving time was observed; otherwise, what
# would have been the point of the 1951 poll?

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-09):
# 'Tokyo' usually stands for the former location of Tokyo Astronomical
# Observatory: E 139 44' 40".90 (9h 18m 58s.727), N 35 39' 16".0.
# This data is from 'Rika Nenpyou (Chronological Scientific Tables) 1996'
# edited by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan....
# JST (Japan Standard Time) has been used since 1888-01-01 00:00 (JST).
# The law is enacted on 1886-07-07.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-16):
# The ordinance No. 51 (1886) established "standard time" in Japan,
# which stands for the time on E 135 degree.
# In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), "standard time" was renamed to "central
# standard time".  And the same ordinance also established "western standard
# time", which stands for the time on E 120 degree....  But "western standard
# time" was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.
# 167, there is no mention regarding for what place western standard time is
# standard....
#
# I wrote "ordinance" above, but I don't know how to translate.
# In Japanese it's "chokurei", which means ordinance from emperor.

# Shanks & Pottenger claim JST in use since 1896, and that a few
# places (e.g. Ishigaki) use +0800; go with Suzuki.  Guess that all
# ordinances took effect on Jan 1.

# From <a href="http://star.arabia.com/990701/JO9.html">
# Jordan Week (1999-07-01) </a> via Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# Clocks in Jordan were forwarded one hour on Wednesday at midnight,

# all year round.
#
# From <a href="http://star.arabia.com/990930/JO9.html">
# Jordan Week (1999-09-30) </a> via Steffen Thorsen (1999-11-09):
# Winter time starts today Thursday, 30 September. Clocks will be turned back
# by one hour.  This is the latest government decision and it's final!
# The decision was taken because of the increase in working hours in
# government's departments from six to seven hours.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2005-11-22):
# Starting 2003 transitions are from Steffen Thorsen's web site timeanddate.com.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-11-23):
# For Jordan I have received multiple independent user reports every year
# about DST end dates, as the end-rule is different every year.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-10-01), after a heads-up from Hilal Malawi:
# http://www.petranews.gov.jo/nepras/2006/Sep/05/4000.htm
# "Jordan will switch to winter time on Friday, October 27".
#

# From Phil Pizzey (2009-04-02):
# ...I think I may have spotted an error in the timezone data for

# The current (2009d) asia file shows Jordan going to daylight

# Google's translation:
#
# > The Council of Ministers decided in 2002 to adopt the principle of timely
# > submission of the summer at 60 minutes as of midnight on the last Thursday
# > of the month of March of each year.
#
# So - this means the midnight between Thursday and Friday since 2002.

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-04-06):
# We still have Jordan switching to DST on Thursdays in 2000 and 2001.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-10-25):
# Yesterday the government in Jordan announced that they will not
# switch back to standard time this winter, so the will stay on DST
# until about the same time next year (at least).
# http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=88950
#
# From Paul Eggert (2012-10-25):
# For now, assume this is just a one-year measure.  If it becomes
# permanent, we should move Jordan from EET to AST effective tomorrow.

# Kazakhstan

# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# Andrew Evtichov (1996-04-13) writes that Kazakhstan
# stayed in sync with Moscow after 1990, and that Aqtobe (formerly Aktyubinsk)
# and Aqtau (formerly Shevchenko) are the largest cities in their zones.
# Guess that Aqtau and Aqtobe diverged in 1995, since that's the first time
# IATA SSIM mentions a third time zone in Kazakhstan.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# German Iofis, ELSI, Almaty (2001-10-09) reports that Kazakhstan uses
# RussiaAsia rules, instead of switching at 00:00 as the IATA has it.
# Go with Shanks & Pottenger, who have them always using RussiaAsia rules.
# Also go with the following claims of Shanks & Pottenger:
#
# - Kazakhstan did not observe DST in 1991.
# - Qyzylorda switched from +5:00 to +6:00 on 1992-01-19 02:00.
# - Oral switched from +5:00 to +4:00 in spring 1989.

# <a href="http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm">
# From Kazakhstan Embassy's News Bulletin #11 (2005-03-21):
# </a>
# The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
# daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
# complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
#
# From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
# ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
# was "blended" with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
# two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
# closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
# same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtobe, Atyrau,
# Mangghystau, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
# everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
# de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

# Mongolia

# Shanks & Pottenger say that Mongolia has three time zones, but
# usno1995 and the CIA map Standard Time Zones of the World (2005-03)
# both say that it has just one.

# From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):
# <a href="http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm">
# General Information Mongolia
# </a> (1999-09)
# "Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
# Bayan-Ulgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
# the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
# eight hours."

# From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
# Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
# being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
# unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
# of implementation may have been different....
# Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
# zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
# Suhbaatar, and possibly Khentij.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
# Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
# We'll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
# the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
# and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
# is good enough for our purposes.

# From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
# In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
# (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),
# there are three time zones.
#
# Provinces [at 7:00]: Bayan-ulgii, Uvs, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai
# Provinces [at 8:00]: Khovsgol, Bulgan, Arkhangai, Khentii, Tov,
#	Bayankhongor, Ovorkhangai, Dundgovi, Dornogovi, Omnogovi
# Provinces [at 9:00]: Dornod, Sukhbaatar
#
# [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]

# From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):
# Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.
# It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of
# September.... As I remember this rule was changed in 2001.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-04-17):
# For now, assume Rives McDow's informant got confused about Friday vs
# Saturday, and that his 2001 dates should have 1 added to them.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
# We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia's time zones.
# Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says
# there is only one time zone and that DST is observed, citing Microsoft
# Windows XP as the source.  Risto Nykanen (2005-05-16) reports that
# travelmongolia.org says there are two time zones (UTC+7, UTC+8) with no DST.
# Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-20) reports that the Mongolian Embassy in
# Washington, DC says there are two time zones, with DST observed.
# He also found
# <http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1111634894&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&>
# which also says that there is DST, and which has a comment by "Toddius"
# (2005-03-31 06:05 +0700) saying "Mongolia actually has 3.5 time zones.
# The West (OLGII) is +7 GMT, most of the country is ULAT is +8 GMT
# and some Eastern provinces are +9 GMT but Sukhbaatar Aimag is SUHK +8.5 GMT.
# The SUKH timezone is new this year, it is one of the few things the
# parliament passed during the tumultuous winter session."
# For now, let's ignore this information, until we have more confirmation.

# From Ganbold Ts. (2007-02-26):
# Parliament of Mongolia has just changed the daylight-saving rule in February.
# They decided not to adopt daylight-saving time....
# http://www.mongolnews.mn/index.php?module=unuudur&sec=view&id=15742

# From Deborah Goldsmith (2008-03-30):
# We received a bug report claiming that the tz database UTC offset for
# Asia/Choibalsan (GMT+09:00) is incorrect, and that it should be GMT
# +08:00 instead. Different sources appear to disagree with the tz
# database on this, e.g.:
#
# <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1026">
# http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1026
# </a>
# <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_MN.aspx">
# http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_MN.aspx
# </a>
#
# both say GMT+08:00.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-31):
# eznis airways, which operates several domestic flights, has a flight
# schedule here:
# <a href="http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112">
# http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112
# </a>
# (click the English flag for English)
#
# There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbatar arrive
# about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
# direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khvod takes 2 hours in the Eastern
# direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbatar and Khvod are
# in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
# Ulaanbatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):
# Assume that Choibalsan is indeed offset by 8:00.
# XXX--in the absence of better information, assume that transition
# was at the start of 2008-03-31 (the day of Steffen Thorsen's report);
# this is almost surely wrong.

# Pakistan

# From Rives McDow (2002-03-13):
# I have been advised that Pakistan has decided to adopt dst on a
# TRIAL basis for one year, starting 00:01 local time on April 7, 2002
# and ending at 00:01 local time October 6, 2002.  This is what I was
# told, but I believe that the actual time of change may be 00:00; the
# 00:01 was to make it clear which day it was on.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-03-15):
# Jesper Norgaard found this URL:
# http://www.pak.gov.pk/public/news/app/app06_dec.htm
# (dated 2001-12-06) which says that the Cabinet adopted a scheme "to
# advance the clocks by one hour on the night between the first
# Saturday and Sunday of April and revert to the original position on
# 15th October each year".  This agrees with McDow's 04-07 at 00:00,
# but disagrees about the October transition, and makes it sound like
# it's not on a trial basis.  Also, the "between the first Saturday
# and Sunday of April" phrase, if taken literally, means that the
# transition takes place at 00:00 on the first Sunday on or after 04-02.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09):
# DAWN <http://www.dawn.com/2002/10/06/top13.htm> reported on 2002-10-05
# that 2002 DST ended that day at midnight.  Go with McDow for now.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2003-03-14):
# According to http://www.dawn.com/2003/03/07/top15.htm
# there will be no DST in Pakistan this year:
#
# ISLAMABAD, March 6: Information and Media Development Minister Sheikh
# Rashid Ahmed on Thursday said the cabinet had reversed a previous
# decision to advance clocks by one hour in summer and put them back by
# one hour in winter with the aim of saving light hours and energy.
#
# The minister told a news conference that the experiment had rather
# shown 8 per cent higher consumption of electricity.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-05-15):
#
# Here is an article that Pakistan plan to introduce Daylight Saving Time
# on June 1, 2008 for 3 months.
#
# "... The federal cabinet on Wednesday announced a new conservation plan to help
# reduce load shedding by approving the closure of commercial centres at 9pm and
# moving clocks forward by one hour for the next three months.
# ...."

# Paracel Is
# no information

# Philippines
# On 1844-08-16, Narciso Claveria, governor-general of the
# Philippines, issued a proclamation announcing that 1844-12-30 was to
# be immediately followed by 1845-01-01.  Robert H. van Gent has a
# transcript of the decree in <http://www.phys.uu.nl/~vgent/idl/idl.htm>.
# The rest of the data are from Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-25):
# Tomorrow's Manila Standard reports that the Philippines Department of
# Trade and Industry is considering adopting DST this June when the
# rainy season begins.  See
# <http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=politics02_april26_2006>.
# For now, we'll ignore this, since it's not definite and we lack details.
#
# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2006-04-26):
# ... claims that Philippines had DST last time in 1990:
# http://story.philippinetimes.com/p.x/ct/9/id/145be20cc6b121c0/cid/3e5bbccc730d258c/
# [a story dated 2006-04-25 by Cris Larano of Dow Jones Newswires,
# but no details]

# Sri Lanka
# From Paul Eggert (1996-09-03):
# "Sri Lanka advances clock by an hour to avoid blackout"
# (www.virtual-pc.com/lankaweb/news/items/240596-2.html, 1996-05-24,
# no longer available as of 1999-08-17)
# reported ``the country's standard time will be put forward by one hour at
# midnight Friday (1830 GMT) `in the light of the present power crisis'.''
#
# From Dharmasiri Senanayake, Sri Lanka Media Minister (1996-10-24), as quoted
# by Shamindra in
# <a href="news:54rka5$m5h@mtinsc01-mgt.ops.worldnet.att.net">
# Daily News - Hot News Section (1996-10-26)
# </a>:
# With effect from 12.30 a.m. on 26th October 1996
# Sri Lanka will be six (06) hours ahead of GMT.

# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2006-04-14), quoting Sri Lanka News Online
# <http://news.sinhalaya.com/wmview.php?ArtID=11002> (2006-04-13):
# 0030 hrs on April 15, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006 +30 minutes)
# at present, become 2400 hours of April 14, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006).

# From Peter Apps and Ranga Sirila of Reuters (2006-04-12) in:
# <http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-04-12T172228Z_01_COL295762_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-SRILANKA-TIME-DC.XML>
# [The Tamil Tigers] never accepted the original 1996 time change and simply
# kept their clocks set five and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean
# Time (GMT), in line with neighbor India.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-18):
# People who live in regions under Tamil control can use [TZ='Asia/Kolkata'],
# as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.

# From K Sethu (2006-04-25):
# I think the abbreviation LKT originated from the world of computers at
# the time of or subsequent to the time zone changes by SL Government
# twice in 1996 and probably SL Government or its standardization
# agencies never declared an abbreviation as a national standard.
#
# I recollect before the recent change the government annoucemments
# mentioning it as simply changing Sri Lanka Standard Time or Sri Lanka
# Time and no mention was made about the abbreviation.
#
# If we look at Sri Lanka Department of Government's "Official News
# Website of Sri Lanka" ... http://www.news.lk/ we can see that they
# use SLT as abbreviation in time stamp at the beginning of each news
# item....
#
# Within Sri Lanka I think LKT is well known among computer users and
# adminsitrators.  In my opinion SLT may not be a good choice because the
# nation's largest telcom / internet operator Sri Lanka Telcom is well
# known by that abbreviation - simply as SLT (there IP domains are
# slt.lk and sltnet.lk).
#
# But if indeed our government has adopted SLT as standard abbreviation
# (that we have not known so far) then  it is better that it be used for
# all computers.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-25):
# One possibility is that we wait for a bit for the dust to settle down
# and then see what people actually say in practice.

# 4th, advancing clocks one hour ahead on midnight of Thursday April 3rd."
# Since Syria is two hours east of UTC, the 2200 and 2100 transition times

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-18):
# My buest guess at a Syrian rule is "the Friday nearest April 1";
